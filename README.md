# FPGA Verilog Designs 

This project explores the design of various digital modules in Verilog on FPGAs, ranging from simple clock dividers and linear feedback shift registers to more complex state machines and circuits designed by combining each of these. Examples of complex circuits designed were a variable delay echo synthesizer which utilised a FIFO to store data, before it was distorted and fed back to create the echo effect; and a race start countdown circuit implemented as a state machine.

Each Part has its own folder as well as a corresponding PDF inside it explaining the results obtained in each part and each experiment. 
All the code for each module and top file in a given experiment is provided.
