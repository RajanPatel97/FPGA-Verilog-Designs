# FPGA Verilog Designs 

The FPGA echo synthesizer was the result of the culmination of 18 different mini projects. Initially building blocks such as adders, multipliers, buffers, clocks and memory units were designed from the ground up using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).

Then all of these individual modules were pieced together to form a complete echo synthesizer that could produce an echo of a sound sample with customizable output settings. 

Each Part has its own folder as well as a corresponding PDF inside it explaining the results obtained in each part and each experiment. 
All the code for each module and top file in a given experiment is provided.
